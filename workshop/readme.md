## Research Questions Activity

Break into groups of three or four people (smaller depending on attendance). Each group will receive an index card with a research question on it. These are all based on published work, but you need not be concerned if you don't recognize the source or know much about the subject. Your goal, as a group, is to see how many of the following questions you can answer (or address) based on what is implied by the question itself.

1. What is the research question? Can it be divided into subtopics?
2. Would there be a way to look at texts (exploratory or confirmatory) to convert this question into a quantifiable answer? If so, how? If not, why not?
3. What factors might complicate or limit the role that computational text analysis might play in addressing your research question. These might be logistical (how do you identify verbs?) or conceptual (how do you measure agency?) or anything in between.
4. What would be some necessary considerations in designing a study? What kinds of texts would you need to be able to access or have collected, described, or categorized ahead of time?
5. If you had to pursue this topic starting today, where would you begin?

Take up these questions for approximately 15 minutes. We will share ideas with everyone at the end. Discuss with your group how you will present (i.e., who will speak about what, etc.).

## Workshopping your research questions

If you shared questions during the survey portion, this will be a chance to dig into their particular complexities.

We can also discuss exploring tools, finding resources, forming partnerships, and setting goals.
