        <h1>Background on Cather, McClure, and Ghostwriting <em>My Autobiography</em></h1>

<p>Numerous scholars have written about Cather's role in the making of S.S. McClure's autobiography. Sharon O'Brien's biography of Cather
emphasizes that the author's coming-of-age required outgrowing her role as "the deferential daughter to two fathers":
Henry James, her aesthetic father, and McClure, her professional father (288). According to O'Brien,
Cather had to outgrow these relationships in order to move from McClure's editor to a novelist of national significance.
Robert Thacker, responding to O'Brien, argues that Cather's "gift of sympathy" was the major force behind her participation--
"That is, she wrote it as a favor and out of gratitude for all he had done for her since their first meeting in 190" (126).</p>

<p>He argues that the experience of subordinating her writing style in favor of McClure's first-person voice was critical in the formation of her
autobiographical realism," which is a major presence in Cather's fiction (124). Where Thacker focuses on McClure's influence on Cather's fiction,
Deborah Lindsey Williams and Emmy Stark Zitter offer close readings of My Autobiography aimed at exposing Cather's subjectivity in the its
narrative voice. Williams identifies textual signs of Cather deploying the ghost as a kind of "open secret" paralleling her own queerness,
and Zitter interprets traces a writer empowering herself by taking on and eventually turning away from the voice of a male narrator.</p>

<p>The common thread in this scholarship is an interest in the impact (biographical and textual) of Cather's involvement in the creation of
<em>My Autobiography</em>.</p>

<p>Cather took on the autobiography in June of 1912. It's posible that she and McClure had discussed the project sooner, but it took on new
urgency when McClure was ousted from his own company in May of that year. Cather agreed to ghost the autobiography without payment;
profits would go toward the debt McClure owed to his former magazine. The autobiography appeared in monthly installments in <em> McClure's Magazine </em>
from October 1913 to May 1914, with an additional installemnt in June made up of reader praise for the autobiography.
Mcclure then revised the serial version for book publication without Cather's help. He integrated excerpts from fan letters but made only limited changes
to Cather's version.</p>

<p>Cather's role in the autobiography is not in dispute, but the extent to which the autobiography evokes her writing style has been much discussed.
Authorship attribution techniques cannot judge the qualitative feel of the narrative voice, but they can analyze the 'latent style' of the autobiography--i.e.
subtleties like how one uses articles, prepositions, pronouns and other "function words." Writers tend to pay less attention to these terms when writing,
so they act like a kind of authorial fingerprint, allowing a computer to distinguish between two authorial candidates.</p>
