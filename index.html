    <div class="two_thirds_fill_content"><h4>Summary and Interpretation</h4>
	<div class="interp">
	    On the surface, the results of this study are quite clear, yet they may also suggest some deeper implications. To summarize:
	<ul>
	    <li>For book serial as a whole, Cather wins 24 head-to-heads, McClure wins none.</li>
	    <li>In one test for installment 8 and two tests for installments 2, 4 and 6 , McClure beats Cather's "Three American Singers." These are McClure's only victories in the entire set.</li>
	    <li>Cather texts of various genres, dates, and lengths win over <em>Obstacles to Peace</em>.</li>
	    <li>Results hold true for serial and books version, using culling=0 and culling=100.</li>
	    <li>Mean margins of victory for book version are slightly smaller than magazine version, but not significant enough to link to any edits.</li>
	    <li>Cather's "Training for the Ballet," <em>My Antonia</em>, <em>The Professor's House</em>, and <em>Obscure Destinies</em>
	    rank in the top six margins of victory for all tests.</li>
	    <li>Cather's <em>Lucy Gayheart</em> and "Plays of Real Life" rank in the top six margins of victory in two tests respectively.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<p class="interp">Cather's consistent victory in head-to-heads is not necessarily surprising, as biographical and archival research has long suggested that McClure supplied subject matter for
	his autobiography, whereas Cather was the only person known to have put pen to paper for the serial version.</p>

	<p class="interp">Further, for these tests, any changes McClure made to the book version of the autobiography were not extensive enough to swing
	authorship attribution results toward his signal.</p>

	<div class="block_div">
	<table class=mean_margin>
	<tbody>
	<th class="dark">Tests</th>

	<td>Book, no cull</td>

	<td rowspan="2">0.01024246</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Serial, no cull</td>
	<td>0.1761647</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Book, cull 100</td>
	<td> 0.1625078</td>
	<td rowspan="2">0.008458941</td>

	</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>

    <div class="next_to_margin"><p class="interp">The mean margin of victory for the serial version vs. the book version, however, shows traces of a
    slight bend toward McClure, but the absolute differences of these margins are too small to attribute this bend to McClure's edits to the book version.</p>
    </div>

    </div>

	<div class="block_div"><p class="interp">Finally, this approach creates similarity rankings among various texts by Cather, and it's highly suggestive (and well worth further investigation) that
	<em>My Antonia</em> and <em>The Professor's House</em> so demonstrably and consistently rank similar to <em>My Autobiography</em>, especially when we consider
	the way she connected <em>My Antonia</em>, in various letters, to her ghostwriting experience, as well as the thematic and structural links
	of both novels to the first-person voice of a male narrator for McClure's autobiography.</p></div>
    </div>

    <div class="one_third_fill_content" id="bottom"><h4>Next Steps</h4>
    <p class="next">The biggest limitation of this study is its dependence on McClure's <em>Obstacles to Peace</em>. McClure authored very few texts,
    but some of his personal letters could be transcribed and analyzed using these methods. Cather's letters should be added to the comparison to create analytical parity.</p>
    <p class="next">Although the correction methods I used are reliable, the impact of additional hand correction should be considered.</p>
    <p class="next">Additional study should be conducted to account for McClure's victory over "Three American Singers" in some cases.</p>
    <p class="next">I plan to do similar testing on <em>The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science</em>.</p>
